# cia.py - A simple interactive-fiction game interpreter

...implemented in Python as a learning experiment.

### About ###

This program is an interactive-fiction (IF) game (aka, "text adventure") called
"CIA", originally published as a BASIC program in the book "BASIC Fun With 
Adventure Games" by Susan Drake Lipscomb and Margaret Ann Zuanich (pub. by Avon 
Books, 1984, ISBN 0-380-87486-4).

I decided to convert the game from BASIC over to Python, in order to learn the 
basics (no pun intended) of Python. The concept of the game belongs to the 
original authors, but the Python version I release to the Public Domain.

The following link should allow you to download a PDF copy of the book, which is
